# Multimodal Biosignal Analysis

This project focuses on cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) analysis during motor tasks and external stimuli. The
framework integrates real-time measurement and visualization during experiments, as well as post-processing and
in-depth statistical analysis afterwards. EEG and EMG signals are recorded externally, while ECG, force, and galvanic
skin response are simultaneously monitored from a serial connection to a custom microcontroller circuit. Music
playback is controlled programmatically as an experimental stimulus.

The code was developed as a student project at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich (UZH) and ETH
Zurich, and is a **WORK IN PROGRESS**.


## 1. What is the goal?
The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive, multimodal biosignal analysis platform that enables
researchers to study the coupling (coherence) between cortical neural signals and muscular activity during motor tasks
and in response to external stimuli, while also capturing cardiac activity, physical force, and skin conductance
markers via a custom microcontroller. The platform supports the full research lifecycle from data acquisition through
statistical reporting.

## 2. How is it done?
The system implements measurement and visualization modules for real-time data acquisition and display during
experiments. EEG and EMG are recorded externally using dedicated acquisition hardware (OTB4 interface), while ECG,
force, and galvanic skin response are acquired through a serial connection to a custom Teensy microcontroller circuit.
Advanced post-processing pipelines handle OTB4 file import, multimodal data integration and time alignment,
signal preprocessing, feature extraction, and comprehensive statistical modelling (omnibus and post-hoc testing), with
a dedicated reporting pipeline for result visualization.

## 3. Why this approach?
Cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) analysis serves as a potential biomarker for motor recovery and rehabilitation,
offering key insights into the functional connectivity between motor cortex activity and muscle activation. By
quantifying the synchronization between brain and muscle signals, CMC helps in understanding cortico-muscular control
mechanisms, motor coordination, and plasticity after injury or disease. This approach allows researchers to
non-invasively probe the integrity and efficiency of motor pathways, making it especially relevant for
neurorehabilitation and motor neuroscience. Integrating real-time monitoring of cardiac, force, and autonomic signals
with externally recorded EEG/EMG improves experimental control and data richness, supporting reliable, comprehensive
analyses.

## 4. What's next?
- Conduct and finalize the statistical analysis
- Extend CMC computation pipeline
- Improve test coverage in `tests/`
